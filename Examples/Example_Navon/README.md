Navon task

===========================================================

In the Navon's task, a large letter (global level) composed of smaller letters (local level) in which the global and 
the local letters could be the same (consistent) or different (inconsistent).

The paradigm is based on these questions. 
1. “Do we perceive a visual scene feature-by-feature? 
2. Or is the process instantaneous and simultaneous as some Gestalt psychologists believed? 
3. Or is it somewhere in between?” (Navon, 1977, 353).

Navon found that found two effects which he argued supported 
“..the notion that global processing is a necessary stage of perception prior to more fine-grained analysis” (p. 371): 
(i) responses to the global level were faster than responses to the local level, and 
(ii) when the levels were inconsistent, information at the global level interfered with (slowed down) responses to the local level, 
but not the other way around.

The basic finding of Navon’s work is that people are faster in identifying features at the global than at the local level. 
This effect is also known as global precedence.

An example of a Navon figure is shown below. The figure has a global feature, it looks like an H. 
Its local feature are the many small letters X the figure is made of. 
People are typically quicker detecting an H than an X.

X X         X X     
X X         X X
X X         X X
X X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X X
X X         X X
X X         X X
X X         X X

In this study, four letters, "E", "N", "Q", and "X" are presented with both local and global features consistent or inconsistent.
There are 48 trials. On each trial, you get up to 4 seconds to decide whether you see a target letter ("E", "N", "Q", and "X") 
at the local or global level, or not. On each trial, you need to respond with a key press ("1", "2", "3", "4"). 
There are clear instructions at the start on how to exactly respond, and there is practice trial with feedback before the task begins. 
According to the theory, you should respond fastest (and made fewest mistakes) in the global condition.
